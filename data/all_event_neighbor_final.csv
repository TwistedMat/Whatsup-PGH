If you’re itching to travel outside this walkable neighborhood, it’s easy. Downtown is the hub of the transit system, so bus service and T-stations can carry you all the way to the outskirts. To explore beyond Downtown, cross a bridge and you’re on the North Side or South Side. Or walk a mile or two and find yourself in the Strip District.

Pittsburgh has often been called ""a drinking town with a football problem,"" so join us to find out how true that is!
You will meet some colorful characters that made this city the boozy, blue-collar cousin to Reno, NV. And if you're lucky, you'll even learn a little history along the way.
This walking tour is a fun and unique experience for all ages to enjoy (meaning, we won't be stopping at any establishments to partake in their selection, but we'll be pointing out some bars and restaurants along the way for you to visit afterwards).
The tour runs approximately 45 minutes and is entirely outdoors (approximately 6 city blocks).",POINT (1343346.391542045 412353.2884263299),1334,4.2003E+11,0.64,Central Business District,17,24,27,0,,"Downtown Pittsburgh offers residents and visitors more than ever: From the Pittsburgh Cultural District and its many theaters, restaurants and nightspots to Market Square with its European piazza flair, there is a spot for everyone and every occasion.

Keller Williams' Grateful Grass featuring Love Canon,10/28/2021 0:00,7:00 pm - 9:00 pm,"101 6th Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15222",Music,https://trustarts.org/production/67689/keller-williams-grateful-grass-featuring-love-canon,"""DEFINITION: Loose interpretations of Grateful Dead songs done in a bluegrass style. Take my fascination with Grateful Dead songs and mix it together with my love of psychedelic improvisational bluegrass music and out burps this project.
WARNING: If you like your Grateful Dead songs performed in their original way, or if you prefer traditional bluegrass, this is not the project for you. If you like singing along to Dead songs in that song’s normal tempo but dancing double time to the music, this is definitely your jam. A lot of people seem to dig it and I dig them for that.
Playing this music this way is such a blast that it probably should be illegal.” — Keller Williams
Keller’s Grateful Grass delivers anything-but-traditional bluegrass versions of Grateful Dead favorites. Grateful Grass often times has a rotating lineup and, in the past, has included collaborations with The Keels, Keith Moseley, Jeff Austin, Michael Kang, Reed Mathis, Bill Nershi, Allie Kral, Vince Herman, Sam Grisman, and The Infamous Stringdusters. This time, Grateful Grass features Love Canon, whose seasoned, virtuosic string players are known for bringing acoustic-roots sensibilities to the electronic-tinged pop hits of the 80s and 90s.
In 2008, the original Grateful Grass members (Keller, Jeff Austin and Keith Moseley) recorded a live performance at The Fillmore in Denver, CO. 100% of the proceeds from REX (Live at the Fillmore) went to benefit The Rex Foundation, the charitable non-profit started by the Grateful Dead.
In 2010 Grateful Grass took the stage at DelFest for the first live appearance since 2008. In 2013, Grateful Grass ft. Keller, Jeff Austin, Keith Moseley and Michael Kang reunited to benefit the Rex Foundation once again at The Fillmore in San Francisco for the event, Nightfall of Diamonds. Once again this performance was recorded and DOS was released in 2014. All proceeds continue to benefit the Rex Foundation.

CIRCLES: going in is a full-length dance work celebrating #BlackGirlMagic. Layering dance, visual arts, and a live original score, the work presents snapshots of popular culture through choreographer Staycee Pearl’s lens as a Black woman. CIRCLES is a colorful, unapologetic, and daring path to self-reclamation. CIRCLES is amplified by an original soundtrack created by Herman “Soy Sos” Pearl in collaboration with a diverse roster of club artists including Queen Jo, Ixa, DJ Haram, Kilamanzego, Kha’DJ, DOTGOV, Madame Dolores, Yah Lioness, Meejah, & Geña.
Immerse yourself in the accompanying CIRCLES: reclamation art exhibit at the August Wilson Center gallery from October 9 - 31 featuring Black visual artists including Staycee Pearl, Bekezela Mguni, Kitoko Chargois, and sarah huny young. Works will draw from their shared explorations of Blackness and self-reclamation.
